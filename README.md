# verifyX

A blockchain-based product authenticity verification platform built on Stellar. Sellers register products on-chain, buyers verify authenticity using unique Product IDs — no middlemen, no fakes.

stellar keys generate deployer --network testnet
stellar keys fund deployer --network testnet

# Deploy the contract
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/verifyx.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet

# Save the returned Contract ID to frontend/.env
```

### Update Frontend

## Smart Contract Functions

The Soroban smart contract provides three main functions:

### `add_product(manufacturer: Address, name: String, brand: String) -> u64`
Registers a new product on the blockchain.
- **Parameters:** Manufacturer address, product name, brand
- **Returns:** Unique Product ID
- **Requires:** Wallet signature (enforced via `require_auth()`)
- **Features:**
  - Auto-incrementing product IDs
  - Persistent storage on Stellar blockchain
  - Event emission for off-chain tracking
  - Authorization verification

### `get_product(id: u64) -> Product`
Retrieves product details by ID.
- **Parameters:** Product ID
- **Returns:** Product struct (id, name, brand, manufacturer)
- **Read-only:** No wallet required
- **Error Handling:** Panics with "Product not found" if ID doesn't exist

### `verify_product(id: u64) -> bool`
Verifies if a product exists on-chain.
- **Parameters:** Product ID
- **Returns:** `true` if genuine, `false` if not found
- **Read-only:** No wallet required
- **Use Case:** Quick authenticity check without fetching full details

### `get_product_count() -> u64`
Returns the total number of registered products.
- **Returns:** Total product count
- **Read-only:** No wallet required
- **Use Case:** Statistics and product ID validation

### Advanced Contract Features

✅ **Authorization & Security**
- `require_auth()` ensures only product owners can register
- Address-based ownership verification
- Secure transaction signing via Freighter wallet

✅ **Persistent Storage**
- Products stored permanently on Stellar blockchain
- Efficient key-value storage using `DataKey` enum
- Auto-incrementing counter for unique IDs

✅ **Event Emission**
- Publishes "register" events for off-chain indexing
- Enables transaction tracking and history
- Supports real-time notifications

✅ **Comprehensive Testing**
- Unit tests for all functions
- Mock authentication for testing
- Edge case coverage (non-existent products, counters)

✅ **Production Ready**
- Deployed on Stellar Testnet
- Verified contract ID: `CAZLH6BM7ZCQKJFQK65LMZ2JVKBNWPA322QK4UNNG4OGXBZVXCHYOHCW`
- Gas-optimized operations

## How It Works

### For Sellers (Product Registration)

1. **Connect Wallet** — Click "Connect Freighter Wallet" in the header
2. **Fill Product Details** — Enter product name and brand
3. **Register On-Chain** — Sign the transaction with your wallet
4. **Get Product ID** — Receive a unique ID to share with buyers
5. **Track History** — View all registered products in the transaction history

### For Buyers (Product Verification)

1. **Enter Product ID** — Input the ID received from the seller
2. **Verify** — Click "Verify Product" to check authenticity
3. **View Results** — See product details and manufacturer address
4. **Blockchain Proof** — Genuine products show ✅, fake/unregistered show ❌

### Transaction History

- Displays last 10 registered products
- Shows Product ID, name, brand, and timestamp
- Direct links to Stellar Explorer for blockchain verification
- Stored locally in browser (persists across sessions)
- Clear history option available
